It does not envy, it does not boast, it is\\nnot proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not\\neasily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil\\nbut rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes,\\nalways perseveres. (1 Corinthians 13:4–7 NIV)_\\n\\nPaul wrote at least two letters to the church at Corinth. And a significant\\nportion of each was dedicated to resolving problems within the church. This\\nwas a divided church that was lacking in love. And, in this passage, Paul\\nseems to be addressing many of their failures, contrasting them with the love\\nthey should have for each other. A love that, if demonstrated toward each\\nother, would resolve their issues.\\n\\nIn these four verses, Paul provides us with a definition of biblical love,\\nlisting some things that love is, and others that it is not. What is common\\namong all of them is that love is others-focused. Love looks to build others\\nup, even at the expense of self. Love, as described here, is not a matter of\\nhow I feel, but of what I do.', metadata={'source': 'https://medium.com/a-clay-jar/a-definition-of-biblical-love-1-corinthians-13-4-7-5e370b978875', 'title': 'A Definition of Biblical Love — 1 Corinthians 13:4–7 | by Ed Jarrett | A Clay Jar | Medium', 'description': 'Love is patient, love is kind.

There will be certain domains, such as sales, where developers can\\nmake AIs extremely accurate by limiting the areas that they work in and giving\\nthem a lot of training data that’s specific to those areas. But one big open\\nquestion is whether we’ll need many of these specialized AIs for different\\nuses—one for education, say, and another for office productivity—or whether it\\nwill be possible to develop an artificial general intelligence that can learn\\nany task. There will be immense competition on both approaches.\\n\\nNo matter what, the subject of AIs will dominate the public discussion for the\\nforeseeable future. I want to suggest three principles that should guide that\\nconversation.\\n\\nFirst, we should try to balance fears about the downsides of AI—which are\\nunderstandable and valid—with its ability to improve people’s lives. To make\\nthe most of this remarkable new technology, we’ll need to both guard against\\nthe risks and spread the benefits to as many people as possible.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun', 'title': 'The Age of AI has begun | Bill Gates', 'description': 'Bill Gates explains why AI is as revolutionary as personal computers, mobile phones, and the Internet, and he gives three principles for how to think about it.', 'language': 'No language found.'}), Document(page_content='I thought the challenge would keep them busy for two or three years. They\\nfinished it in just a few months.\\n\\nIn September, when I met with them again, I watched in awe as they asked GPT,\\ntheir AI model, 60 multiple-choice questions from the AP Bio exam—and it got\\n59 of them right. Then it wrote outstanding answers to six open-ended\\nquestions from the exam. We had an outside expert score the test, and GPT got\\na 5—the highest possible score, and the equivalent to getting an A or A+ in a\\ncollege-level biology course.\\n\\nOnce it had aced the test, we asked it a non-scientific question: “What do you\\nsay to a father with a sick child?” It wrote a thoughtful answer that was\\nprobably better than most of us in the room would have given. The whole\\nexperience was stunning.\\n\\nI knew I had just seen the most important advance in technology since the\\ngraphical user interface.\\n\\nThis inspired me to think about all the things that AI can achieve in the next\\nfive to 10 years.\\n\\nThe development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor,\\nthe personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the\\nway people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each\\nother. Entire industries will reorient around it.
